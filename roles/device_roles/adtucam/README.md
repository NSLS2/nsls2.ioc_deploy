# adtucam

Ansible role for deploying adtucam IOC instances. Source code is in the [ADTucam driver](https://github.com/NSLS2/ADTucam).

Originally written for the AXIS-SXRF-40 which has the Tucsen Dhyana 4040BSI camera electronics and uses the TUCAM SDK to interact with the camera. TUCAM SDK and any frame grabber drivers should be installed separately.
